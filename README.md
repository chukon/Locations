Locations
=========

iOS Project that demonstrates the use of Core Location and Map Kit.

This single view application will call the CLLocation Manager and upon success the screen will turn blue. If no successful updates can be obtained the screen will turn yellow.

Coordinates are displayed as numeric values underneath a Map View, into which the updated coordinates are fed whenever an update occurs. In addition, a CLGeocoder updates human readable street information when available.
